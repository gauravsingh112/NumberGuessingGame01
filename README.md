# NumberGuessingGame
 - This is a simple C++ console-based number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the player to guess the number. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the number.
# How to Play
 - Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.
 - Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use g++ on Linux or MinGW on Windows.
 - Run the compiled executable.
 - The game will display a prompt to enter your guess. Enter an integer between 1 and 100 and press Enter.
 - The game will provide feedback on your guess. If the guess is too high, it will display "Too High!" If the guess is too low, it will display "Too Low!" If the 
    guess is correct, it will display "CORRECT!" along with the number of tries it took to guess correctly.
 - Keep guessing until you guess the correct number.
